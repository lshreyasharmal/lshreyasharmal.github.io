Hi, I am a Software Developer at Oracle! Earlier this year, I got my Masters degree in Computer Science at [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/).

## About Me

At Hopkins, I primarily worked on Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning, and Software Development at institutes like [Center for Language and Speech Processing](https://www.clsp.jhu.edu/) (CLSP), [dearYou Health](https://www.dearyouhealth.org/tech-board), and [SNF Agora Institute](https://snfagora.jhu.edu/). My research at CLSP with [Dr Benjamin Van Durme](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~vandurme/) and [Dr Daniel Khashabi](https://danielkhashabi.com/) focused on making language models use and understand scientific facts to reason like humans and create analogies from text within a given context. Apart from that, I led the development team at dearYou Health to create a mobile app that connects students with mental health professionals under the guidance of [Dr Ali Madooei](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alimadooei/). More recently, I have ventured into Natural Language Processing for Computational Social Science with [Dr Hahrie Han](https://www.hahriehan.com/) for social and political analysis on megachurch sermons in the US.

Prior to my Masters, I worked at [MakeMyTrip](https://www.makemytrip.com/about-us.html), India's top travel e-commerce site, as a Senior Software Developer. I built microservices, APIs, and scripts to improve and automate data processes, using Spring-Boot and Django for the MyBiz platform of MMT. Over 3 years, I moved up from a Software Developer to a Senior position. Before that I got my Bachelors degree in Computer Science form [IIIT Delhi](https://www.iiitd.ac.in/) in India in 2019. As an undergraduate, I enjoyed doing research work in machine learning, computational biology, and natural language processing resulting into prestigious publications.
