Hi, I recently graduated with a Masters in Computer Science at [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/) in May 2024.

Checkout my [Resume]({{site.url}}/files/Resume_Shreya_Sharma.pdf) and if you think there is a fit for me, feel free to reach out!

At Hopkins, I've primarily worked on Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning, and Software Development projects at [Center for Language and Speech Processing](https://www.clsp.jhu.edu/) (CLSP), [dearYou Health](https://www.dearyouhealth.org/tech-board), and [SNF Agora Institute](https://snfagora.jhu.edu/). My research at CLSP with [Dr Benjamin Van Durme](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~vandurme/) and [Dr Daniel Khashabi](https://danielkhashabi.com/) focuses on developing language models that can use and understand scientific facts to reason like humans and can create analogies from text within a given context. I also led the development of a mobile application to connect students to medical professionals for mental health services at dearYou Health under the guidance of [Dr Ali Madooei](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alimadooei/). More recently, I have ventured into Natural Language Processing for Computational Social Science with [Dr Hahrie Han](https://www.hahriehan.com/) on curating databases on megachurches in United States for social and political analysis.

Prior to my Masters, I worked at [MakeMyTrip](https://www.makemytrip.com/about-us.html), India's top travel e-commerce site, as a Senior Software Developer, where I developed microservices, APIs, and scripts to improve and automate data processes, using Spring-Boot and Django. Over 3 years, I moved up from a Software Developer to a Senior position.

I graduated with a Bachelors in Technology, Computer Science form [IIIT Delhi](https://www.iiitd.ac.in/), India in 2019 where I explored machine learning, computational biology, and software development as part of my research.
