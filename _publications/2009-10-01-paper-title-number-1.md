excerpt: 'The importance of predictive maintenance for air conditioners due to various potential faults is highlighted in this paper. Gas leakage and capacitor malfunction, two common issues, are detected using the decision tree machine learning algorithm. Data collected from sensors and microcontrollers are analyzed using MATLAB Classification App Learner Toolbox. The decision tree method shows higher prediction accuracy compared to the support vector machine. This research aims to identify faults early and enable proactive maintenance to mitigate efficiency loss, energy consumption increase, and maintenance costs.'

Various types of faults can
occur in an air conditioner resulting in a decrease in efficiency, a
rise in energy consumption, and increasing maintenance costs. Hence
predictive maintenance becomes important. In this paper, the two most
common types of faults - gas leakage and capacitor malfunction have been
 detected using the decision tree machine learning algorithm. The data
for faulty and operating air conditioners have been collected using
distributed sensors, microcontroller, and dedicated circuitry and
analyzed using MATLAB Classification App Learner Toolbox. The results
obtained by the decision tree for fault detection and diagnosis and load
 monitoring were then compared with results obtained by support vector
machine and the prediction accuracy for the decision tree was found to
be higher. The presented research work can identify the air conditioner
which is faulty as well as predicts the type of fault at an early stage
to do maintenance beforehand.
