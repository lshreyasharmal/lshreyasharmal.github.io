excerpt: 'This study compiled single-cell expression data of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) from various cancers, revealing a continuum of epithelial to mesenchymal transition. Analysis also identified an inverse gene expression pattern between PD-L1 and MHC, relevant to cancer immunotherapy. A classifier trained on CTC and peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) transcriptomes accurately recognized diverse CTC phenotypes. Additionally, this classifier validated circulating breast tumor cells captured using a novel label-free microfluidic system for CTC enrichment.'

We collated publicly available single-cell expression profiles of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and showed that CTCs across cancers lie on a near-perfect continuum of epithelial to mesenchymal (EMT) transition. Integrative analysis of CTC transcriptomes also highlighted the inverse gene expression pattern between PD-L1 and MHC, which is implicated in cancer immunotherapy. We used the CTCs expression profiles in tandem with publicly available peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) transcriptomes to train a classifier that accurately recognizes CTCs of diverse phenotype. Further, we used this classifier to validate circulating breast tumor cells captured using a newly developed microfluidic system for label-free enrichment of CTCs.
